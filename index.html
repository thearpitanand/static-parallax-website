          Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu
          trinity that includes Brahma and Vishnu. In the Shaivite tradition,
          Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the
          universe. In the Shakta tradition, the Goddess, or Devi, is described
          as one of the supreme, yet Shiva is revered along with Vishnu and
          Brahma. A goddess is stated to be the energy and creative power
          (Shakti) of each, with Parvati (Sati) the equal complementary partner
          of Shiva. He is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana
          puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.

          Shiva is the primal Atman (soul, self) of the universe. There are many
          both benevolent and fearsome depictions of Shiva. In benevolent
          aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic
          life on Mount Kailash as well as a householder with wife Parvati and
          his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya. In his fierce aspects, he is
          often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva,
          regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation and arts.
